Conmio Markup task
==================

1. GENERAL GUIDELINES
The image provided represents two layouts of an imaginary mobile web service - an iPad portrait view (canvas 768px wide) and an iPhone portrait view (canvas 320px wide). Instead of creating separate HTML/CSS markups, create one markup and make the UI and content responsive so that they adapt no matter what the display width is. Consider also the landscape orientation (iPad 1024px wide, iPhone 480px wide). Minimum width the UI should adapt to is 320px.
- Use HTML5 for the markup.
- Replace the black box at the top of the page with your name. It can be either text or image. You can replace the texts with any lorem ipsum.
- Deliver the task to GitHub and let us know where to find it.

2. ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES
The navigation menu resides off-canvas and is brought out by pressing on the arrow icon at the top left. The top portion of the navigation menu should be fixed to viewport, while the category elements (starting from “Uutiset”) can be scrolled vertically, if there are more elements beyond the screen height.
When opened, the navigation menu pushes the content to the right with a transition. In the tablet version, the menu pushes the right column off the screen. Menu is closed by pressing the arrow icon again or by touching outside the menu column.
- Make sure you take both device orientations, portrait and landscape, into account. 
- Notice that the navigation menu becomes smaller on the iPhone.

3. WHAT WE LOOK FOR
When evaluating your submission, we will pay most attention to your markup semantics, clarity, conventions and logic used as well as page responsiveness to resizing.
If you feel the guidelines are missing something and you have to use your own judgement, you may explain your decisions as a comment in the code or in a separate document.
